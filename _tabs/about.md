Hello there, I am an engineering student based in India, who loves **Math**, **Physics**, and has slowly started liking **Computer Science**.

My areas of interest in CS are Programming languages (I love Python) and Algorithms, with a touch of the Machine Learning theory. 

As far as my education is concerned I am pursuing my bachelors and integrated masters at IIT Kharagpur, in **Chemical** and **Financial Engineering**, with a minor degree in CS. A peculiar combination, I know!


The purpose of this blog is to present forth my understanding of subjects and help people like me and you, who wander place to place to get an authentic and truthful explanation to their queries.
