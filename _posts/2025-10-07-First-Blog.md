# The Prose of life :


## Is life Cruel ? 
> Don't you think, life is cruel. Not because we meet some very bad people or something bad happens to us, but because of the very perishable nature of life ? I mean <b>yes, I could be a billionaire or a beggar in the course of life</b> but at the end, it doesn't seem to have made a difference, I would die eventually leaving behind all my wealth and my so-proud achievements. The strange part, for most of us <i> the normal </i>  human beings, even the 3<sup>rd</sup> generation after us might not remember us.

## What is our Purpose? 
>  Then what is the purpose of this life? **What shall be the goal of our lives ?** What shall we put our energy into ? One could spend his entire lifetime just gaining knowledge and still at the end it will all dissolve or burn into ashes. One could be a remarkably good employee, a developer, a civil servant or even the prime minister, but all of us are entitled to the same ultimate damn fate. To die and be forgotten some day. 

## Are we taking a random walk? 
> Then why did nature decide to give us life ? **Is there something nature wants to fulfill using us as a medium ?** Otherwise life is just a random walk then. A 50-50% chance game. Everything is random, and thus there is no meaning in this chaos. Pure Noise ? ( Although we don't want to believe this ever. )


These are all **strange questions**, I have ever had till now, which are mostly unanswered. 


<p>
But why is my first blog about these ? That's because they are the fundamental problems, I and maybe many of us fail to acknowledge and fail to answer. I thus want to keep them here, saved, untouched, so that they remind me and others as well, that there are certain things which one should give a thought. It is a scary idea, I know but it is inevitable.
